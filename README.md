# UniVResity-Face-to-Face-Class-Participation-for-Remote-Students-using-Virtual-Reality
ABSTRACT:<br />
We describe a prototype of the virtual reality remote classroom participation system called UniVResity. UniVResity mirrors in virtual reality the ongoing face-to-face classroom activities, taking into account potentially low bandwidth data connection and lack of VR equipment in class. Our system attempts to combine the benefits of online education and face-to-face education, and makes face-to-face learning more accessible.
